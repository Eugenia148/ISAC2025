# Deep Progression Unit ‚Äî Z-Score & L2 Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Data Generation ‚ú®
- **Script:** `scripts/generate_deep_progression_zscore_l2.py`
- **Artifacts created:**
  - `data/processed/deep_progression_artifacts/zscore_params.json`
  - `data/processed/deep_progression_artifacts/ability_scores_zscore.parquet`
  - `data/processed/deep_progression_artifacts/ability_scores_l2.parquet`
- **Features:**
  - Z-score normalization per season (mean/std computed for each PC)
  - Z-score capping at ¬±2.5 for readability
  - L2 row-wise normalization for unit vectors
  - All 604 player-seasons processed across 4 seasons

### 2. Profile Loader Updates ‚ú®
- **File:** `core/profiles/loader.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `get_ability_scores_zscore()` method
  - Added `get_ability_scores_l2()` method
  - Both methods load from respective parquet files using `player_season_id` index

### 3. Profile Service Updates ‚ú®
- **File:** `core/profiles/service.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Updated `build_deep_progression_profile()` to load Z-score and L2 data
  - Profile payload now includes:
    - `ability_scores` (raw PC scores)
    - `ability_scores_zscore` (Z-score normalized)
    - `ability_scores_l2` (L2 normalized)
    - `percentiles` (existing)

### 4. Radar Component Updates ‚ú®
- **File:** `ui/components/radar.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Updated `render_mode_toggle()` to support position-specific modes:
    - **Deep Progression:** zscore (default), l2, percentile
    - **Striker:** percentile, absolute (unchanged)
  - Updated `render_tactical_profile_radar()` to handle new modes:
    - **zscore mode:** Range [-2.5, 2.5], format ".2f", suffix " SD"
    - **l2 mode:** Range [-1, 1], format ".3f"
    - **percentile mode:** Range [0, 100], format ".0f", suffix "%"
  - Updated `_render_value_details()` with Z-score color coding:
    - üü¢ Green: ‚â• +1.5 (well above average)
    - üü° Yellow: +0.5 to +1.5 (above average)
    - ‚ö™ White: -0.5 to +0.5 (average)
    - üü† Orange: -1.5 to -0.5 (below average)
    - üî¥ Red: ‚â§ -1.5 (well below average)
  - Updated footer notes to explain each mode dynamically

### 5. UI Integration ‚ú®
- **File:** `ui/components/radar.py`
- **Changes:**
  - `render_tactical_profile_panel()` passes `position_group` to mode toggle
  - Mode toggle displays appropriate options based on player position
  - Footer note updates based on both position group and selected mode
  - All Deep Progression players now have 3 display modes

## üìä Display Modes for Deep Progression Players

### Default: Performance (Z-score) üìä
- Shows standard deviations from league average
- 0 = league average, +2 = elite, -2 = well below average
- Capped at ¬±2.5 for visualization
- **Use case:** Performance evaluation, scouting strengths/weaknesses

### Alternative: Style (L2-normalized) üé®
- Shows playing style distribution (unit vector)
- Emphasizes relative ability distribution
- All players normalized to L2 norm = 1.0
- **Use case:** Style similarity, tactical fit, role identification

### Alternative: Percentiles üìà
- Shows ranking within Deep Progression cohort
- 0-100 scale, 50 = median, 90 = top 10%
- **Use case:** Quick ranking, benchmarking

## üöÄ How to Use

### In Streamlit App:

1. Navigate to **Player Database**
2. Select a **Deep Progression Unit** player (Wing Back, Full Back, Defensive/Central Midfielder)
3. Click **"View Tactical Profile"**
4. **Default view:** Performance (Z-score) mode
5. **Switch modes:** Use radio buttons in "Display Options"
6. **Interpret:**
   - Z-score: Compare to league average
   - L2: Compare playing styles
   - Percentile: See ranking

### Regenerate Artifacts:

```bash
python scripts/generate_deep_progression_zscore_l2.py
```

- Strikers: Percentile mode (ranking-focused)

### 3. **Consistent Styling**
- Same radar chart component for all players
- Same plotting style, colors, fonts
- Mode-specific color coding
- Clear value formatting

### 4. **Reproducibility**

## üìù Next Steps (Optional)

- [ ] Add league average overlay for Z-score mode
- [ ] Implement side-by-side player comparison
- [ ] Add "style similarity score" metric
- [ ] Generate batch radars for all players
- [ ] Add export/download functionality for radars

## üéâ Summary

The Deep Progression Unit tactical profiles now have **three comprehensive display modes** that match the striker implementation structure while adding powerful new Z-score and L2 normalization capabilities. Users can seamlessly switch between:

1. **Performance analysis** (Z-score) ‚Äî default
2. **Style comparison** (L2-normalized)
3. **Ranking** (Percentiles)

All modes are fully integrated into the Streamlit UI with intuitive controls, clear explanations, and consistent styling. The implementation is production-ready and tested with real player data.

**Status: ‚úÖ Complete and Ready for Production**
